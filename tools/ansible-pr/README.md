# Ansible PR Script
This is a Ruby script that creates a series of PRs to ansible/ansible.

All PRs are made from the `build/ansible` folder.

Pull Requests are made from the origin remote to Ansible core.
By default, the origin remote points to MM's version of Ansible

## Requirements
* `hub` CLI
* `build/ansible` has the origin remote properly setup.
